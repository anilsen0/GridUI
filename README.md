# GridUI
# Grid.UI is an open source software that allows users to develop UI (User Interface) for different devices, work with drag-and-drop logic on the grid, use pre-specified tools, and make pre-prototypes very quickly. The Grid.UI does not aim to address the professional user audience, but sets its audience as developers looking for a new, uncomplicated, free tool.
